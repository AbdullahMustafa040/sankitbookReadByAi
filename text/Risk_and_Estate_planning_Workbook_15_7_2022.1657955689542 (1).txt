their calculations where they need to decide how much income would be required to provide adequate
income to care for the two children: Eva, age 10 and Emma, age 8, until each child reaches age 18.
Step one is determining the amount of cash inflow required to sustain a desirable lifestyle for Frieda,
Eva and Emma. This process involves looking at the budget, backing out expenses directly related to
Frederick, and settling on the appropriate amount. Calculations would need to factor an acceptable
inflation rate so purchasing power would remain relatively constant. We will also need to agree to a
discount rate (i.e., return on savings/investments). For our purposes, let’s settle on the following:

RISK PLANNING SPECIALIST
NUMERICAL SHEET SOLUTIONS
1) Solution:
“Risk” is defined as a possibility that the actual outcome may differ from the expected outcome. The
word “possibility” here, signifies, “uncertainty”. So, insurance can be offered only when there is an
uncertainty in the outcome of an event. Here, Mahesh is suffering from cancer & his death is
“inevitable - i.e. certain”. So, offering him insurance wouldn’t be feasible.
Kindly note that, although “death” is a certain outcome for all of us, insurance basically covers the
“timing” of death. The moment, the timing is certain, the concerned individual loses out on his option
to protect him through insurance.
1. Solution:
Insurance covers “financial risks” (i.e. risks which can be quantified in terms of money) but it cannot
issue an insurance policy to cover any risk which cannot be quantified in financial terms. Both the
risks stated above (“love & affection” & “leadership qualities”) are “non-financial risks” & so cannot
be insured.
2. Solution:
Insurance only covers “pure risks” (i.e. pure risks have only two possible outcomes - either a loss or
no loss, but never ever a possibility of gain). Jay is into buying & selling of shares (i.e. speculative
activity). Insurance doesn’t cover speculative activities. If insurance started covering speculative
activities then everybody will try to profit out of insurance - thus defeating the whole objective and
purpose of insurance.
3. Solution:
Life insurance covers death caused due to any means. Even if death has been caused on account of a
natural disaster & if the insured has been paying premiums regularly, the same would be covered
under life insurance. (However, if Mr. Gada is staying in area which is prone to earthquakes or has
earthquakes more often, and say he applies for a life insurance cover, then the insurance company
may either: 1. Specifically exclude death on occasion of an earthquake or
2. Include death on occasion of an earthquake but with an increase in premiums or
3. Reject his request for life insurance completely).
4. Solution:
Unless otherwise stated in the policy, damage/destruction caused to property on account of any natural
disaster is specifically excluded under general insurance (Key: - The movie, “Oh my god”)
5. Solution:
Insurance covers only “particular risks & static risks” (i.e. risks which affect only individuals & not
the whole population). It doesn’t cover “dynamic & fundamental risks” (i.e. risks which occur due to
changes in economy or which affect large section of the population). Fire, theft & misappropriation
FINANCIAL PLANNING ACADEMY

9

RISK & ESTATE PLANNING SPECIALIST

are particular risks & so would be covered under insurance. While inflation, political upheavals &
technological changes are fundamental & dynamic risks & thus cannot be covered under insurance.
6. Solution:
The insured would only be able to recover Rs. 400,000, even if the property is actually worth Rs.
15,00,000. If the insured was able to recover Rs. 15,00,000 and so make a profit out of insurance, this
would constitute a wager (i.e., speculation), which would be against the true nature of insurance.
7. Solution:
The insurance would only pay the agreed value of Rs 2,00,000 & not Rs 3,00,000. Furthermore, the
insurer would still pay Rs. 2,00,000 even if the value of the item actually declined to Rs 1,00,000.
8. Solution:
In this case the second policy would be hit by the “Principle of Contribution”. Raising a request
with both the companies means he is paid twice for a single claim, thus the claimant would end up
profiting from insurance.
If an insured person has coverage under two indemnity insurance policies, he has the right to choose
under which policy he wants to make the claim. If the claimed amount us higher than the sum insured
under the policy on which he has first made the claim, the insured person can claim the balance amount
from the second indemnity policy.
9. Solution:
As per the “Principle of Subrogation”, once the claim amount is settled, the insurer steps into the
shoes of the insured (i.e. in this case, ICICI Lombard, will step into the shoes of Mr. Jay) & is entitled
to recover from the defaulting party a sum (to the extent paid to the insured). The principle of
subrogation thus stops the insured from profiting out of insurance. Unnati will not pay anything to
Jay.
10. Solution:
Ms. Mehta was suffering from high diabetes at the time of death. Moreover, she didn’t disclose her
family history of diabetes at the time of taking the policy. In this case, she has breached the “principle
of utmost good faith” & Max Life insurance can repudiate the claim on this ground. The claim has
now become voidable at the option of Max Life Insurance.
11. Solution:
As per the principle of “insurable interest”, there has to be a financial interest in the subject matter
to be insured, i.e. Mr. Mehta should incur a financial loss if Mr. Shah’s bungalow gets burnt down by
fire. Since, Mr. Mehta won’t incur a financial loss if Mr. Shah’s bungalow gets burnt down by fire (he
would incur a loss only if the fire is spread to his bungalow), Mr. Mehta won’t be eligible to buy
insurance on Mr. Shah’s bungalow.
12. Solution:
As per the “principle of proximate cause” - the initial event in the chain of events that caused the
loss needs to be looked at while accepting claim settlement requests. The rule is that for the loss to be
paid or compensated under an insurance policy, it must have been caused by an insured peril. Unless
FINANCIAL PLANNING ACADEMY

10

RISK & ESTATE PLANNING SPECIALIST

the loss is proximately caused by an insured peril, the policy doesn’t pay or respond. In this case, the
furniture was thrown out of the house to arrest the spreading of the fire. Mr. Patil had taken an
insurance policy against fire. Since, fire is an insured peril, the loss of damage of furniture gets
covered.

13. Solution:
-In this case, the “suicide clause” has automatically been triggered. The suicide clause gets triggered,
if the insured commits suicide within 1 year of taking the life insurance policy. If the policyholder
commits suicide within 1 year, his family will not be able to avail the benefit of getting the sum
assured.
14. Solution:
LIC won’t settle the claim as insurance cannot be taken for an illegal objective.
15. Solution:
The current value of the house would be the sale price less the value of the land (land is not covered
by insurance), assuming the sale price was not overinflated. Therefore, the amount covered would be
Rs. 19,33,000.
Note: In accident policies the economic loss sustained by the insured is calculated by referring to
lost income, medical bills, set amounts detailed in the policy for specified injuries or sicknesses and,
in the case of residual injuries, the levels of damages awarded by the courts.
16. Solution:
If a car is purchased for Rs. 2,50,000 and insured for Rs. 3,00,000 an insurer would be required to
only pay Rs. 2,50,000 and be prevented from voiding the policy.
17. Solution:
Amount Paid by the Insurer will be = 25,00,000/45,50,000 * 15,00,000
= Rs. 824175.8242
Therefore, the amount paid by the Insurer would be Rs. 8,24,176.
18. Solution:
If the house suffered damage of Rs. 12,00,000
12,00,000 * 67% = Rs. 8,04,000
Therefore, the amount of claim received for house to Mr. Pradeep will be Rs. 8,04,000.

By adding the two amounts: 1141684.021 + 192466.1822 = Rs. 1334150.203
If no liquid assets or existing insurance is available, Rs. 1334150 is the amount of life insurance
the Frederick’s would need to fund this future income stream.
If we were doing a full life-insurance needs calculation, we would move forward to determine
amounts needed to fund Frieda’s pre-retirement and retirement-period income (based on what
the couple decides that amount should be). If the Faber’s want to fund all or part of their
daughter’s university tuition, we would also work through the amount necessary for that need.
The result, after adding all the amounts, is likely to be quite large. This would be true in many
situations, and is one reason why term life insurance is often best for providing the necessary
death benefit at the most cost-effective (and non-budget busting) premium. In the case of the
Faber’s, we would probably recommend a 10-year level-term life insurance policy to fund the
need while Eva and Emma remain at home.
It may be that a different type of life insurance would make more sense for Frieda’s preretirement or retirement need, but we would need more information to make that
determination. We would need to know about available discretionary income, balanced by the
need for other investment funding. Also, we would need to find out whether Frieda would be
working outside the home after the girls leave, and if so, what impact that would have on her
retirement-funding needs. Finally, whether from investments or other sources, we need to
determine Frieda’s net financial need during both the pre-retirement and retirement periods.
We will not work through these calculations, but you should recognize this as another example
of the holistic, inter-related nature of financial advice.
The proper method to assess risk exposures is to conduct a step-by-step audit. If an advisor does
a complete risk management plan, he or she would assess each of the risk exposure areas. In
some cases, the client may desire a more focused approach, and the advisor should adapt
accordingly. As an example, the client may have already addressed all healthcare related risk
exposures, and does not want to include that area in a broader risk-assessment audit. At the
same time, an advisor should not assume that any area has already been addressed. It’s best to
assess all potential areas of need and let the client advise otherwise if appropriate.

2) How much would an insurance policy reimburse a homeowner who has a house valued at R.
40,00,000 insured for Rs. 30,00,000 after experiencing a fire that causes Rs. 2,00,000 in damage? The
house has an 80 percent coinsurance provision and a Rs. 10,000 deductible.
Solution:

Insurance would reimburse the homeowner Rs. 1,77,500 as a result of the coinsurance penalty for
being underinsured. Required insurance is 80 percent of replacement value or Rs. 32,00,000, and the
house is insured for 93.75 percent of the required amount. To determine the amount that will be
reimbursed, divide Rs. 30,00,000 by Rs. 32,00,000 and multiply the loss amount by the result, then
subtract the deductible: Rs. 30,00,000 / 32,00,000 = .93.75 x Rs. 2,00,000 = Rs. 1,87,500 – Rs. 10,000
= Rs. 1,77,500.
3) Mr. Kelkar owns a flat worth (market value) Rs. 20,00,000 in the outskirts of Mumbai. He had
insured it only for Rs. 16,00,000. The flat is damaged by an earthquake (he had requested cover from
natural & manmade disasters too), which loss is assessed at Rs. 4,00,000. How much claim payment
Mr. Kelkar will get?

FINANCIAL PLANNING ACADEMY

RISK & ESTATE PLANNING SPECIALIST
Solution:

As per the “principles of average”, the claim amount that is payable to Mr. Kelkar would be as follows:
Amount payable by the insurance company = (Sum insured/ Market Value) * Loss
= (16,00,000/ 20,00,000) * 4,00,000
Therefore, claim payable = Rs. 3,20,000.
The objective of the “principle of average” is that, if there is an underinsurance, the insured is
considered to be his own insurer to the extent of the underinsurance. This means, the insured will
bear part of the loss as a penalty for underinsurance.
4) A couple with no dependants and age 60 years (male) and 58 years (female) has a corpus of Rs. 1
crore. Their expectancy to live is 80 years (male) and 83 years (female). Following are the annuity

12) Following are the details of Mr. Alok are:
Earnings: Rs 1,00,000 p.a.
Debts: Rs. 1,28,572
To support dependent’s 75% of pre -death salary (if no death)
Assuming simple interest of 7% per annum, how much times current annual salary does he need in
terms of life insurance? Use the Capital Retention Method.
a) 10 times
b) 8 times
c) 12 times
d) 16 times
Solution:

Insurance required (using the Capital Retention Approach) = Annual Earnings / Rate of Return. Now
annual earnings required to support dependents (75% of pre-death salary) = 100000*0.75 = 75000.
Therefore, insurance required = 75000/0.07 = 1071429
Insurance covered required = 1071429+128572
= 1200000
i.e. approximately 12 times the current annual salary.

14) The sales literature of an insurer, pertaining to a particular participating policy, claims that in the
past, the company had paid maturity benefits of 2.5 times the basic sum assured on their 15 years
endowment policies. The company uses the uniform Simple reversionary bonus system and the
terminal bonus system to distribute profits to its participating policyholders. Assuming that a uniform
reversionary bonus rate of Rs.35 per thousand sum assured was declared over the last 15 years, a basic
sum assured of Rs.50,000 and level annual premiums of 5,066, calculate the terminal bonus content
in the maturity proceeds (ignore mortality).
a. 5 0 , 0 0 0
b. 48, 750

c. 83,767
d. 75,000
Solution:

Maturity Value = Sum Assured + Reversionary Bonus + Terminal Bonus. Maturity Amount =
50000*2.5 = 125,000.
Reversionary Bonus = 35*50000/1000*15 = 26250.
Now, Terminal Bonus = Maturity Value – Sum Assured - Reversionary Bonus.
Therefore, Maturity Benefit=125000-50,000–26250=48,750.

20) Miss Jagruti resides in Mumbai with her husband, Mr. Jignesh & has taken 2 Mediclaim policies
covering the same peril. Policy A (issued by ABC Insurance company) is worth Rs. 4,50,000 while
Policy B (issued by XYZ insurance company) is worth Rs. 2,00,000. She incurs Covid (Coronavirus)
& is immediately hospitalized. The total cost of hospitalization comes to around Rs. 2,50,000. Miss
Jagruti approaches you, a qualified financial planner, inquiring if he could raise a claim request (of
Rs. 2,50,000) to both the companies (i.e. company ABC & XYZ). What would you suggest?
Solution:

In this case the second policy would be hit by the “Principle of Contribution”. Raising a request
with both the companies means he is paid twice for a single claim, thus the claimant would end up
profiting from insurance.

If an insured person has coverage under two indemnity insurance policies, he has the right to choose
under which policy he wants to make the claim. If the claimed amount is higher than the sum insured
under the policy on which he has first made the claim, the insured person can claim the balance amount
from the second indemnity policy.

Solution:

The insured would only be able to recover Rs. 45,00,000 even if the property is actually worth Rs. Rs.
85,00,000. If the insured was able to recover Rs. 85,00,000 and so make a profit out of insurance, this
would constitute a wager (i.e., speculation), which would be against the true nature of insurance.

c) Malicious damage due to negligence of the farmer
d) Damage caused by birds or animals
Answer (b)
2. Insurers consider four factors as requirements for an insurable risk. One of the reasons why it may
not be possible to purchase insurance to cover a certain peril or the coverage premium may be so high

a)
b)
c)
d)

The loss must be by chance.
The loss must be measurable and able to be defined.
The law of large numbers must apply.
The loss must not be financially catastrophic
Answer: (d)

Reason: The loss must not be financially catastrophic. A catastrophic loss to an insurer is not the same
as a catastrophic loss to an individual. Loss of a house might be financially catastrophic to a family.
However, loss of one house would not make much financial difference to an insurer. On the other
hand, the loss of 10,000 houses could definitely be financially catastrophic for an insurer, to the extent
that the company might no longer be viable as a business. This is one of the reasons why it may not
be possible to purchase insurance to cover a certain peril.

20. As people in most territories are living longer, they often require another level of healthcare. In
many places, hospital-based care tends to be somewhat short-term. A financial advisor skilled in eldercare advice can be of tremendous benefit to an elderly person or the adult children of an elderly person looking
for long-term care. Long-term care insurance is the insurance product specifically designed to help pay for the
long-term care needs individuals may have. An important part of this process is helping clients determine how
much long-term care coverage may be needed. Which of the following statements regarding long-term care is
most likely correct?

a) Long-term care (LTC) is generally divided into three categories: skilled nursing care, intermediate
care, and custodial care. Insurance companies often use a list of activities of daily living (ADLs)
to determine when coverage will be triggered. Similar to disability income insurance policies,
long-term care policies use an elimination period that substitutes a dollar amount for a time period
that functions as a deductible. Maximum benefit periods typically range from two years to 10
years.
b) Long-term care (LTC) is generally divided into two categories: skilled nursing care, and
custodial care. Insurance companies often use a list of activities of daily living (ADLs) to
determine when coverage will be triggered. Long-term care policies do not use an elimination
period. Maximum benefit periods typically range from two years to 10 years.
c) Long-term care (LTC) is generally divided into three categories: skilled nursing care, intermediate
care, and custodial care. Insurance companies often use a list of activities of daily living (ADLs)
to determine when coverage will be triggered. Similar to disability income insurance policies,
long-term care policies use an elimination period that substitutes a dollar amount for a time period
that functions as a deductible. Benefit periods are typically lifetime benefits.
d) Long-term care (LTC) is generally divided into four categories: skilled nursing care, intermediate
care, home-care, and custodial care. Insurance companies often use a list of activities of daily
living (ADLs) to determine when coverage will be triggered. Long-term care policies do not use
an elimination period. Maximum benefit periods typically range from two years to 10 years.
